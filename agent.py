# Scaffolding: this file shows how you would connect a Language Model to the scheduler and comm tools.


from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import Tool, initialize_agent


# Tools wrap service functions: patient lookup, find slots, book_slot, send_message


# Example (pseudo):
# patient_lookup_tool = Tool(name='patient_lookup', func=lookup_fn, description='Find patient in EMR')
# scheduling_tool = Tool(name='scheduling', func=find_and_book_fn, description='Find availability and book')
# comm_tool = Tool(name='comm', func=send_communication, description='Send email/SMS')


# n.b. Use LangGraph when you want multi-agent orchestrations. This file is a minimal example showing where to wire tools.
